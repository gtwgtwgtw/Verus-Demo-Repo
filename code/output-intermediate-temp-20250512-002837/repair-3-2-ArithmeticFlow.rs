Below is an example of how you might insert an assertion (or set of assertions) right before computing next_fib.  
The key idea is to ensure that fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2] is within the bounds of an i32,  
leveraging the requirements and invariants that (1) i ≥ 2, and (2) fibo_fits_i32(n - 1).  

In particular, the loop invariant already tracks that each fib entry at index k  
is equal to fibo(k). Therefore fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2] = fibo(i-1) + fibo(i-2) = fibo(i).  
Since i < n and fibo_fits_i32(n - 1) guarantees fibo(n - 1) < 2^31, we also have fibo(i) < 2^31.  

Below is a patched version, illustrating a direct “assert” sequence. Depending on your proof style,  
you could also introduce a lemma (for example, lemma_fibo_monotonic) to show fibo is non-decreasing,  
but in many proofs the loop invariant (fib[k] == fibo(k)) and the fibo_fits_i32(n - 1) requirement  
are sufficient to establish the bound:

Explanation:

• The extra pre-assertion steps (comparing fib[i - 1], fib[i - 2] to fibo) use the loop’s invariant that  
  fib[k] == fibo(k). They demonstrate that next_fib = fibo(i).  
• Because i < n, and fibo_fits_i32(n - 1) → fibo(n - 1) < 2^31, we have fibo(i) < 2^31, so next_fib  
  fits in i32 without overflow.  
• This remedies the possible arithmetic overflow while also making it clear in the proof why next_fib  
  must remain within bounds.

//         let next_fib = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
//   None: fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
