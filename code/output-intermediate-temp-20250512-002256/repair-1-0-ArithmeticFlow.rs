Below is an example of how you can add the necessary assertion (and a monotonicity lemma) to ensure that the expression fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2] neither underflows nor overflows. The key points are:

• Express fibo as a recursively defined spec.  
• Write a lemma (lemma_fibo_monotonic) that shows fibo is monotonic in its argument.  
• Just before computing next_fib, assert that the sum fits within i32 by relying on the lemma that fibo(i) ≤ fibo(n-1).

Explanation:

1. We added lemma_fibo_monotonic, which proves that the fibonacci spec is nondecreasing:  
   fibo(i) ≤ fibo(j) whenever i ≤ j.  

2. Just before the line let next_fib = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];, we assert that the impending addition stays within i32 range, making use of the lemma to show fib[i - 1] and fib[i - 2] cannot be too large under the fibo_fits_i32(n - 1) assumption.  

3. The loop invariants and precondition fibo_fits_i32(n - 1) together ensure that for every iteration i, fibo(i) ≤ fibo(n - 1) < 2^31. As a result, there is neither an overflow nor an underflow when adding fib[i-1] and fib[i-2].

//         let next_fib = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
//   None: fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
