This folder includes Rust/Verus translation of all the proof tasks from SV-Comp/array-fpi

These rust files were generated by Jianan Yao in Summer 2023

The original C version of the array-fpi benchmark suite in sv-comp can be seen at
https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/benchmarking/sv-benchmarks/-/tree/main/c/array-fpi?ref_type=heads
(the archive was at https://github.com/sosy-lab/sv-benchmarks/tree/2e1723fde6aa65a250dcb677efa45edaa4b6b631/c/array-fpi)

The proof tasks in this folder is a superset of those in array_fpi-nonl: 
the latter removed all the tasks here that require non-linear algebra to prove
