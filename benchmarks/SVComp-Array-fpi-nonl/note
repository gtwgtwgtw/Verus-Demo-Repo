Tasks in this folder are based on SV-Comp/array-fpi, which seems to be based on diffy, with a few exceptions:
1. All the benchmarks that require non-linear reasoning are removed 
2. The original array_fpi has an integer version and a long version for every task, we only kept one, the integer one

The unverified and verified folders show the unverified (in Rust) and verified versions, respectively.

The original C version of the array-fpi benchmark suite in sv-comp can be seen at
