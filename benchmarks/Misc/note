Proof tasks in this folder come from miscellaneous sources.
A few are from Verus tutorial; the remaining were written during Jianan Yao's internship at MSR in summer 2023; several proofs
were then revamped by Chris Hawblitzel and Jay Lorch in summer 2024. But, there are still some complicated proofs here that probably should be simplified.
